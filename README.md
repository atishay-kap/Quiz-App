# Quiz-App
So to solve the particular Problem I created a roadmap for achieving our desired result that is a quiz app with 2 quizes and a result section
There were several pages to be created for this app
1. The quizes page where the available quizes are shown
2. The result page which is linked with the quizes and showcases all the results of the quizes given overtime
3. The quizes page leads to other pages that contains some questions.
4. 
I'm not very much aware of the react native technology but wanted to try it out and was made possible with the help of AI.
The most difficult part in creating this project was integrating the Android Studio with react native and making the project run.
My enthusiasm towards new technoligies made me try this project.
I'm not at all perfect at this but yes I'm always ready to learn and apply it no matter what the task is.


Unsolved challenge for me was getting myself a hang with react native as I'm not very much into this technology but It was fun doing such a project.
Looking forward to work with you and learn more.
